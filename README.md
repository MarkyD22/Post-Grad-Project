Preventative Maintenance and Calibration Tracking System Manufacturing and Testing Equipment
The goal of this project is to design and develop a Maintenance and Calibration Tracking System that simplifies the process of managing and tracking Preventative Maintenance (PM) and Calibration Tasks for a Small Medium Enterprise (SME) that manufactures Medical Devices and their Sub-assemblies. The system will automate tasks such as generating reports for equipment that requires PMs or Calibration Tasks, link the PM and Calibration Procedures to the respective equipment and provide access to a repository for previously completed PM and Calibration Tasks. The system should also provide a frontpage list of equipment that requires PM and Calibrations in the following 2 weeks of the date of access for the user. This system aims to ensure that all required PMs and Calibration Tasks are completed on time and to ensure that the manufacturing equipment is in compliance with the Quality Management System
